# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Wave Interference

- _Math Square behavior_
- Theo McGrath

## Notes
This exhibit displays a sine wave propagating through the wall and being damped. It starts at the left side moving to the right and then reflects off of the right side of the wall, creating an interference pattern with itself
